                    <h2>Current Political Groups in EU Parlaiment</h2>
                    <p>In this artifact, I analyzed four major political blocs that are shaping debates in the European Union. I focused on how each group positions itself on questions like national sovereignty, immigration, climate change, and the future of EU integration. I found it interesting to see how parties that seem very different at home can join larger groups in Brussels and push common ideas, like the ECR’s focus on sovereignty and free markets or PfE’s strong nationalist agenda. I also looked at the growing presence of far-right alliances like ESN and what that means for the EU’s future stability. Researching this helped me see how Spain’s domestic parties fit into wider European trends. For example, I saw how Vox is not just a Spanish phenomenon but part of a broader rise of nationalist and conservative forces across Europe. Putting this together helped me connect local politics with continental shifts and think about how the balance of power in the EU keeps evolving. This project showed me how Spain’s past conflicts over identity and nationalism continue to echo today through the parties and alliances that shape its role in Europe.</p>

                    <h2>Anarchsim</h2>
                    <p>In this piece, I studied anarchism not just as an abstract idea but as a real movement with deep roots in Spain. I learned how anarchist thought came from 19th-century debates about freedom, power, and workers’ rights. I focused on Giuseppe Fanelli’s role in spreading these ideas and how Mikhail Bakunin’s influence shaped the movement’s collectivist vision. What I found especially interesting was how Spanish anarchism had its own character compared to other countries. Unlike the more urban, individualist style in places like France, Spanish anarchism connected with rural peasants, farm workers, and strong anti-clerical attitudes because of how the church aligned with landowners and elites. I also explored how anarchists in Spain built organizations like the FRE-AIT and later the CNT, blending ideas with practical trade unionism and direct action. This project helped me understand how radical ideas can take shape in specific local contexts and how they continue to influence labor struggles and grassroots organizing today. It made me see how old ideas about workers’ rights and collective action still shape protests, labor disputes, and political conversations happening in Spain now.</p>

                    <h2>1939–1950: Autarky, Misery and Rationing & Isolation</h2>
                    <p>Working on this project about Spain from 1939 to 1950 helped me understand how deeply the consequences of the Civil War and World War II shaped Spain’s place in the world. By researching Franco’s regime and its choice to isolate itself with an autarkic economy, I learned how Spain’s refusal to join the global recovery efforts like the Marshall Plan left it stuck in poverty and misery while the rest of Europe rebuilt. This really opened my eyes to how decisions made by a dictatorship can have lasting impacts on people’s everyday lives, from rationing and black markets to shortages that affected millions. Studying Spain’s diplomatic isolation also showed me how international relations work and how the Cold War eventually forced the United States to see Spain in a new way, as a potential anti-communist ally rather than just a fascist state. This shift explained a lot about how Spain slowly re-entered the world stage and set the groundwork for the changes that would come later. This part of my project really helped me connect the past to the present by showing how Spain’s struggle to modernize and connect globally still influences its politics, economy, and identity today.</p>

                    <h2>España's Democratic Law: Remembering to Move Forward</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I looked deeply at how Spain has tried to deal with the legacy of its Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship through laws that promote historical memory and justice. I focused on the Historical Memory Law passed in 2007 and the newer Democratic Memory Law from 2022. I examined why these laws were needed in the first place, what they actually do, and why enforcing them has been so difficult over the years. One thing that stood out to me was how exhumations of mass graves are still incomplete and how political parties remain divided over whether digging up the past helps or hurts the country today. I also studied how the government connects these laws to human rights and democracy and how parts of society resist them because of deep political divides. This project shows how learning about historical memory is not just about the past but about how a society moves forward, faces uncomfortable truths, and teaches new generations. Working on this taught me how much Spain’s present debates over democracy and justice are still tied to events that happened decades ago and how the way a country remembers can shape its future.</p>
