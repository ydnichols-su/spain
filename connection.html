                <p>Looking back on this course, I see how what I learned connects deeply with my own life, my other studies, and my time experiencing Spain firsthand. Studying the Arts of Spain at the same time made me realize just how much history and art reflect each other and how they shape the way a country remembers its past and builds its present.</p>
                <p>Living in Madrid gave me a chance to see what I was studying come to life every single day. Walking through the same streets where history unfolded made everything feel closer and more real. Visiting the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, the Museo Nacional del Prado, the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, and the National Archaeological Museum let me stand in front of paintings and artifacts that hold centuries of stories. Seeing works by Dalí, El Greco, Jusepe de Ribera, Picasso, Goya, and Velázquez in person changed the way I look at art. Each piece felt like a piece of evidence, a record of what people valued, feared, or dreamed about in their time. When I stood in front of Picasso’s Guernica at the Reina Sofía, I felt the weight of the Spanish Civil War in a way no textbook could ever show me. Seeing Goya’s dark and haunting scenes in the Prado helped me grasp how art can be a warning and a memory at the same time.</p>
                <p>I also got to explore Sevilla, which opened my eyes to parts of Spanish history and culture I did not fully understand before. Sevilla’s winding old streets, the Alcázar with its beautiful gardens and Moorish architecture, the massive Seville Cathedral that towers over the city, and the quiet corners of the old Jewish quarter showed me how many layers of history overlap in one place. Watching flamenco in Sevilla made me see how cultural traditions stay alive through music, dance, and storytelling passed down over generations. I could feel the mix of pride, pain, and celebration in the rhythms and movements, and it reminded me that culture is never frozen in the past because it keeps growing and changing with the people who carry it forward.</p>
                <p>Being in Spain let me see how the past shapes daily life. I noticed it in small things like how late people eat dinner, how plazas stay lively into the night, and how conversations always seem to come back to history or politics in some way. It made me think more deeply about how Spain’s journey through dictatorship, war, and rebuilding still shapes how people see themselves and their country today.</p>
                <p>Connecting all of this to my other classes has pushed me to think about context in a new way. I now pay more attention to what was happening in society when a painting was made or a building was built. I have learned that history is not something you read once and put away. It is something you keep discovering through art, conversations, and even the atmosphere of a city.</p>
                <p>This experience has made me more curious and more open to seeing connections across subjects. Professionally, it has inspired me to think about how I could be part of preserving culture and sharing it with others, maybe through work in museums, education, or cultural exchange programs. More than anything, my time in Madrid and Sevilla taught me that understanding a country’s past makes you see its present in a completely new light. It made me appreciate how people carry their history with them in ways that are visible and invisible, and how art gives us a way to keep asking questions about what we remember and why.</p>
                <p>I feel grateful to have been able to step into these stories and bring them back with me. This experience has changed how I want to learn, how I see the world, and how I hope to keep exploring it in the future.</p>
