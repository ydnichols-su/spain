            <h1>Tracing My Journey Through Spain's History</h1>
            <div class="beginning">
                <p>This semester completely changed the way i understand Spain. Before taking this course, I thought of Spaish history as a series of disconnected political moments. I had general knowledge that Spain had monarchy, went through civil war, and became a Parliamentary Monarchy. But that was about it. I didn't realize how layered, contested, and emotionally charged its history really is. Through the topics we covered and the places I explored in Madrid, I now see that Spain is still coming to terms with its past. What stood out to me most was how space, memory, and identity all come together in very ways. This became especially clear through three places I connected during the semester: España congress building: Congreso de los Diputados, Franco's former residency during his dictatorship: The Royal Palace of El Pardo located in Madrid, and the statue of Alfonso XII in Retiro Park each hold deep meaning. They tell stories about Spain's political transformations, its struggles with power, and the way memory is preserved and contested in public space. </p>
                <p>One of the most powerful moments for me in this course was learning about the Second Republic and the 1931 Constitutiton. The Constituttion aimed to redefien España. It promoted secular education, granted women the right to vote, introduced divorce laws, and tried to build a more equal society. Learning about this moment helped me see the Congress building differently. It is not just a center of politics. It is a place where the hope of an inclusive and democrativ Spain once imagined. That hope was notjust a dream, it was written into law, debated passionately, and defended by people who believed in change.</p>
                <p>Understanding what followed made that hope feel even more fragile. Studying the Spanish Civil War and Franco's dictatorship opened my eyes to a very different side of Spain's history. Franco;s rise was not just the result of military strategy. It was also about fear, ideology, and control. The regime erased freedoms, silenced opposition, and replaced democratic values with authoritarian rule. Seeing Franco's house here in Madrid gave me a strange feeling. It is not just an old building. It is a physical reminder of a regime that reshaped Spain for decades. It represents the silence, the censorship, and the shadow that lingered long after his death. Being able to connect what I learned in class to something I could actually see in the city made it more real. It reminded me that history is not just about the past. It is about how the past still lives among us.</p>

                    <h2>Alfonso XII de España</h2>
                    <p>When I first explored Retiro Park at the beginning of the semester, I passed right by the monument of Alfonso XII without even pausing. At that point, it didn’t feel important, I was more captivated by the water and the mermaid statues I seen surrounding it. Just looked like another royal statue in a beautiful park filled with trees, lakes, and people walking their dogs or rowing boats. But the more I learned in class, the more that statue started to feel like something worth noticing. It became a symbol that helped me understand a much more complicated moment in Spain’s political history.</p><br>
                    <p>The monument itself is massive. It sits on the eastern edge of the park’s main lake, framed by a large semicircular structure with towering columns. At the center, Alfonso XII is shown on horseback, raised high on a pedestal so he’s literally above the people walking below. His posture is stiff and proud. His gaze is fixed straight ahead, as if he is confidently watching over the city and everything is under control. At first glance, it gives off a sense of leadership, power, and stability.</p><br>
                    <p>But after studying the Bourbon Restoration and learning about the political system that followed Alfonso’s return to the throne in 1874, the whole image started to feel different. The restoration of the monarchy was not about fixing the country or making it more democratic. It was about giving the appearance of stability after years of chaos, civil wars, and short-lived governments. On paper, the system looked like a constitutional monarchy with elections and political parties. But in reality, the whole thing was a performance. The elections were manipulated, the same elites passed power back and forth, and the voices of ordinary citizens were completely ignored. It was a system designed to look modern and functional from the outside, while avoiding the deep social and economic problems boiling under the surface.</p><br>
                    <p>Now when I walk past that statue, I do not just see a king. I see the performance of power. I see how governments can use images and monuments to shape how people remember the past. The monument tells a story of calm control and strong leadership, but the history behind it reveals anxiety, manipulation, and fear of real change. It shows how symbols can be used to cover up the truth.<br>
                    The placement of the statue adds another layer to it. Retiro Park today is a place where people come to relax, exercise, go on dates, or spend time with family. It feels free and open. But at the center of that space stands a monument to a period of political control, backroom deals, and fake representation. That contradiction makes me think about how history lives on in the spaces around us. Even a peaceful park can carry traces of struggle and power.</p><br>
                    <p>Throughout this semester, I’ve come to realize that statues and public art are not just background. They are part of a conversation about who gets remembered and how we choose to see the past. That monument, which once seemed unimportant to me, now says a lot. It says something about how Spain tried to move forward while avoiding its real problems. And it says something about how power is often more about how things look than how things actually are.</p>

                    <h2>Franco Residence at Royal Palace El Pardo</h2>
                    <p>I understood Franco as a dictator who ruled Spain through repression, censorship, and military power. That view was not wrong, but it was incomplete. Visiting the palace showed me that Franco also ruled through image, space, and legacy. He did not just govern with fear. He embedded himself into the history of Spanish royalty and wrapped his regime in the symbols of tradition and continuity.</p>
                    <p>The palace itself dates back to the 15th century. It was originally built as a royal hunting lodge and was expanded over time to reflect the power and elegance of the Spanish monarchy. Knowing that, it felt intentional that Franco chose this space as his residence. He did not select a modern military complex or cold government office. He chose a royal palacae with centuries of symbolic euthority behind it. That choice alone told me a lot about how he wanted to be seen; not as a temporary ruler, but as part of the national story.</p>
                    <p>Inside the palace, the details became even more revealing. The modernization of his quaters was not just about comfort. It marked a clear difference between the older royal traditions and Franco's vision of modern leadership. He removed the insulating tapestries and replaced them with paintings. He installed air conditioning and other modern systems, making his living space stand apart from the rest of the estate. It was like he was rewriting the story of the palace, inserting himself as both a continuation of royal history and a break from it.</p>
                    <p>The most powerful moment for me came when I saw the portrait of Queen Isabella I hanging in what used to be his office. Queen Isabelle I is on of España most iconic historical figures, remembered for her role in unifying the country and launching the age of empire. By placing her portrait in his personal workspace, Franco was drawing a direct line between himself and the idea of Spanish unity and strength. He was using her image to legitimize his rule, to present himself not as a dictator, but as a restorer of order. Though, he turned out to be the complete opposite.</p>
                    <p>This visit made me think about how authoritarian regimes use architecture and symbolism to shape national memeory. Franco did not just control the government. He shaped the story Spain told itself. By living in El Pardo, he surrounded himself with the visuals of monarchy, religion, and national tradition. His daghters were even married in the chapel on the estate, further tying his family into the royal legacy. That showed me howpersonal narratives and public authority often blend together in ways that are hard to seperate.</p>
                    <p>After this experience, I started noticing a pattern across Spanish history. Power is often passed down through ritual, tradition, and sace, not just through elections or military action. Franco understood this quite well.  He used the palace to create a version of history that made his rule feel natural, even inevitable. That is what made it so dangerous. It blurred the line between heritage and control. Here is where I learned that authoritarianism is not just a political structure. It is a story in which buildings, symbols, and routines tell  you the story. And to understand that story you have to do more than just read about it in history; you must stand in rooms where it changed lives for the next generation to come, where messages were crafted, and where power was lived in real time.</p>

                    <h2>Congreso de los Diputados</h2>
                    <p>Before this semester, I had no real understanding of how much Spain's political history still echoes in its present institutions. That changed when I visited the <i>Congreso de los Diputados</i>. I had read about the transition to democracy and how the 1978 Constitution marked the beginning of a new era for Spain, but seeing the uilding in person brought the story to life in a way that no textbook could. Every hallway, every room, even the layout of the chamber seemed to speak the language of historical tension, negotiation, and renewal.</p>
                    <p>What surprised me most was how intentional the entire space felt. The display of all the past constitutions at the entrance struck me as a quiet but powerful statement about continnuity and growth. even though Spain has undergone monarchy, republic, dictatorshi[, and finally democracy, all those phases are recognized here, not erased. that felt important. it reminded me of something we discussed in class; that Spain's history is not about clear breaks but about layers. And those layers do not disappear. they are carried forward.</p>
                    <p>The way deputies are seated on opposite sides based onpolitical ideology reminded me of how polarized Spain has been throughout its modern history. From the liberal and conservative splits of the 19th century to the brutal ideological divides of the Spanis Civil War, the idea of left and right in Spanish politicals carries real historical weight. Seeing that layout in person made me think about how political institutions perform their own identity everytime people meet there to debate or vote.</p>
                    <p>I was especially drawn to the <i>Salón de los Pasos Perdidos</i> and the <i>Sala del Reloj</i>. These spaces are more than just rooms. They are sites of political theatre, tradition, and influence. The Salón felt like a place where power is hsown through formality negotiations, told a different storoy. It showed me that political decision-making is not just about open debate but also about what happens away from the public eye. These rooms felt like places where Spain's future was decided long before any formal vote was cast.</p>
                    <p>After visiting the Congress, I started thinking more critically about what democracy really looks like. It is not just about constitutions or elections. It is about how a country builds trust through transperancy, tradition, and space. Spain's parliamentary building power does not only function through laws. It also speaks through buildings, layouts, and the way people physically move through those spaces. That realization changed how I look at governments, both in Spain and beyond.</p>
