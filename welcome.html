                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>I hadn't come to Spain because I had some deep connection to ir or ancestral family who lived here. I came for the beauty, the experience, and the culture. Still, I was cautious. I wasn't sure how I'd be treated because of my race, the way I look, or the way I speak. But even with that in the back of my mind, I can honestly say I had one of the most amazing eperiences here. I was able to dive deep into the culture and the history this place holds.</p>
                    <p>Spain is a country where the past doesn't just sit in books or museums. It lives and breathes through the streets. Its history is still being written. The people don't forget where they come from, and they don't try to hide it. From the music to the dancing, the art to the architecture, España tells its story boldly and loudly everywhere you go.</p>
                    <p>As a descendant from Indigenous people, so I was raised knowing the truth about colonization. My family taught me about what was taken from us, about who Christopher Columbus really was, and about the pain our people were forced to carry. Spain waas the place he came from, so naturally, I grew up viewing it as the land of the colonizers.</p>
                    <p>But I didn't want that to be the onlyl perspective I held. I didn't want to anger be the only thing I carried with me. Being here allowed me to learn things I was never taught back home. Like the fact that Spain actually imprisoned Columbus for his crimes. Or that he died thinking he had reached Asia. It made me question how much of our history has been watered down or completely rewritten in America.</p>
                    <p>And it didn't stop there. I learned about the dictatorship of Franco and how the Catholic Church used its power to control, silence, and opress its people. They kept the working class uneducated and misinformed, not just about their rights but even about the religion they were being told to follow. Spain's current constitution wasn't even passed until the late 1970s. My family is literally older than the democratic system this country now ooperates under.</p>
                    <p>And I can't leave this page without talking about the food. Outside of Guyana, the home of my family, this is some of the best food I've ever had. The freshness, the quality, the car that goes into every ingredient... it's REAL! No chemicals, no over-prpocessinig. Just real food that's grown close by and prepared with pride. No matter what part of Spain you're in, the food reflects the land. It reflects the culture. It's alive.</p>
                    <p>Spain challanged what I thought I knew. It didn't erase my past, and it didn't change what happened. But it gave me the chance to see the full picture. To hold space for more than one truth. And for that, I'm greatful.</p>
